# Welcome to My Kitchen!

Hi! I'm so glad you're here. I've been cooking for my family for years, and I decided to share my love for Indian vegetarian food with everyone.

## A Journey Rooted in Family

I grew up learning these recipes from my mom and grandmother, but I have to give huge credit to my mother-in-law — she's an incredible cook and has taught me so much.

Most of my cooking style actually comes from her techniques and family recipes. She learned these same recipes from her mother-in-law, so there's this beautiful chain of knowledge that's been passed down through generations.

## What Makes Indian Cooking So Special

What I love about Indian cooking is that every family has their own way of making even the most traditional dishes. There are so many different methods and little touches that make each version unique.

The recipes I share here are my way of cooking these dishes — techniques I've learned, adjusted, and perfected over the years in my own kitchen.

## More Than Just Recipes

But this space is about more than just food.

I'm passionate about preserving and sharing our beautiful traditions — so you'll also find:

All of this is part of the rich cultural heritage that makes our traditions so special.

## For Beginners and Experienced Cooks Alike

If you're new to Indian cooking, don't worry! I remember how intimidating it felt when I first started. I explain everything step-by-step and share the little tricks I've learned over the years.

And if you're already comfortable with Indian food, I hope you'll find some new favorites here too.

## Why I Started This

This really started as a way to write down family recipes so I wouldn't forget them, but it's become so much more.

There's something special about sharing a meal you made from scratch, and I love hearing from people who've tried my recipes with their own families.
