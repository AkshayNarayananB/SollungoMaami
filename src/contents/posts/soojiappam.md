## 👩‍🍳 Instructions  

### 1. Prepare the Dough  
- In a mixing bowl, combine **maida** and **salt**.  
- Add water little by little and knead into a sticky dough.  
- Apply oil to hands and knead well for **10–15 minutes** until soft and pliable.  
- Place dough in a bowl, immerse fully in oil (about ½ cup), and rest for **30 minutes to 1.5 hours**.  

### 2. Prepare the Stuffing  
- Dry roast **rava** in a kadai until golden and aromatic. Set aside.  
- In the same kadai, boil **3 cups water**.  
- Slowly add roasted rava, stirring continuously to prevent lumps.  
- Cook until it reaches porridge consistency.  
- Add **jaggery**, mix well, and cook 5–10 minutes until thick.  
- Stir in **cardamom powder** and **ghee**. Switch off flame.  
- Once cooled, roll into **lemon-sized balls**.  

### 3. Shape the Appam  
- Heat oil in a kadai on medium-high flame.  
- Grease a **butter paper** or **banana leaf** with oil.  
- Take a small portion of maida dough and spread thinly with fingers.  
- Place one rava-jaggery ball in the center, cover with dough, and flatten gently.  

### 4. Fry the Appam  
- Drop the prepared appam carefully into hot oil.  
- Fry until puffed and golden brown on both sides.  
- Remove and drain on tissue paper to absorb excess oil.

## 🌟 Tips & Notes  

- **Knead Well** – Soft dough ensures thin, crispy outer shell.  
- **Oil Resting** – Resting dough in oil makes it flexible and non-sticky.  
- **Stuffing Texture** – Ensure rava mixture is thick; too watery stuffing may leak.  
- **Frying Heat** – Oil should be medium-hot, not smoking, for even puffing.  
- **Banana Leaf Tip** – Makes spreading dough easy and adds aroma.
