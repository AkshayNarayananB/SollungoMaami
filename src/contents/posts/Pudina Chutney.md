## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. **Saute Pudina & Coriander:**  
   Heat 2 tbsp oil in a kadai. When warm (not too hot), add pudina and coriander leaves. Saute for 2 minutes, then remove from heat.

2. **Temper Dal & Chilies:**  
   In the same kadai, add 2 tbsp oil. Once hot, add urad dal, chana dal, and dry red chilies. Saute until dals turn light brown.

3. **Add Hing & Vegetables:**  
   Add a pinch of hing. Then add chopped onion, cooking until translucent. Add chopped tomato and cook until mushy. Let this mixture cool.

4. **Grind Base:**  
   Transfer the onion-tomato mixture to a mixer, add salt, and pulse 3–4 times.

5. **Grind Herbs:**  
   Add the sauteed pudina and coriander leaves to the mixer. Grind until smooth.

6. **Final Tempering:**  
   Heat 1 tbsp oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and let splutter. Add urad dal, hing, and 2 dry red chilies. Saute briefly and pour the tempering over the chutney. Mix well.
