3.  Saute: Saute all vegetables for 1 minute, stirring gently.  
4.  Add water and cook: Add 2-3 cups of water to the pan. Cover with a lid and cook for 5-7 minutes until vegetables are tender.  

### Preparing the Coconut Masala  
1.  Grind the paste: In a blender, add grated coconut, cashews, green chillies, cloves, and cinnamon. Add water as needed and grind to a smooth, fine paste.  

### Final Cooking  
1.  Mash vegetables: Once the vegetables are cooked, gently mash them with a masher for about 2 minutes. Don’t over-mash — just lightly crush.

3.  Adjust consistency: Add water if needed to reach your desired consistency.  
4.  Season: Add salt and curry leaves to the kurma.
