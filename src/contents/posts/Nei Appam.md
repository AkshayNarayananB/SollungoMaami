## 🥣 Method

### 1️⃣ Prepare the Dry Mix  
🌀 In a mixing bowl, combine:  
🔹 ¾ cup wheat flour  
🔹 ¼ cup rice flour  
🔹 1 tsp cardamom powder  
🔹 ½ cup coconut pieces  
🌀 Mix well and set aside.

### 2️⃣ Make the Jaggery Syrup  
🔥 In a pan, add 1½ cups water + 1 cup jaggery.  
🔥 Heat on low-medium until jaggery dissolves completely.  
💧 Let it begin to boil—no string consistency needed.  
🖐️ Syrup should feel sticky — turn off the flame.

### 3️⃣ Combine Syrup and Flour  
🥄 Slowly pour the hot jaggery syrup into the flour mix.  
🔁 Stir constantly to avoid lumps.  
💧 Add 1–2 tsp water if batter feels too thick.  
⏲️ Let rest for 15–20 minutes.

### 4️⃣ Cook the Nei Appam  
🍳 Heat appam pan (appe / kuzhi paniyaram pan) on medium-low.  
🧈 Add a little ghee in each mould — just to coat.  
🥄 Pour batter ½ to ¾ full in each mould.

### 5️⃣ Flip and Cook  
🔄 Flip when edges are golden and pulling away.  
⏳ Cook other side for 3–4 mins. Add ghee if needed.  
🔁 Flip once more for even golden crispiness.  
🔥 Always cook on medium-low for best texture.

## ✅ Tips for Perfect Nei Appam

🧈 Use fresh ghee for best aroma.  
🥄 Don’t overfill the moulds — they puff better with space.  
⏲️ Let batter rest to soak up the syrup well.  
🍬 Use dark jaggery for deeper flavor.
