   Add chopped capsicum and saute for about 1 minute, keeping it crunchy.

4. **Add brinjal and cook:**  
   Add the brinjal, mix well so the vegetables are coated with oil. Cover and cook on low flame for 5 to 7 minutes.

   Open the lid, stir the vegetables, and add salt to taste.

6. **Add spices and peanuts:**  
   Mix in the homemade curry powder and ground roasted peanuts thoroughly.
