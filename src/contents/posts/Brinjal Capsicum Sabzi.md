## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Roast and pulse brinjal**:  
   Roast the cut brinjal pieces well until soft. Once cooled to room temperature, pulse them lightly in a mixer jar to get a coarse texture. Set aside.

   Heat oil in a pan on medium flame. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add a pinch of asafoetida.

3. **Cook capsicum**:  
   Add chopped capsicum and sauté for about 1 minute, keeping it crunchy.

4. **Add brinjal and cook**:  
   Add the pulsed brinjal, mix well so the vegetables are coated with oil. Cover and cook on low flame for 5 to 7 minutes.

5. **Season**:  
   Open the lid, stir the vegetables, and add salt to taste.

6. **Add spices and peanuts**:  
   Mix in the homemade curry powder and ground roasted peanuts thoroughly.
