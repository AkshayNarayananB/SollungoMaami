## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. 🧽 Peel the chow chow and thoroughly wash the skin 2–3 times under running water. Use only the middle portion of the skin, discarding the top and bottom parts.  

2. 🔥 Heat oil in a pan. Add urad dal and chana dal, roasting until golden and aromatic.  

3. 🌶️ Add dry red chilies and fry for 1 minute, then add a pinch of asafoetida.  

4. 🍳 Add the chow chow skin pieces and sauté on medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This helps the skin shrink and softens it without burning the dals.

5.  Add tamarind and saute for 1 minute.

6. 🥥 Once cooked, add grated coconut and mix well. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.  

7. 🌀 Transfer the mixture to a blender, add salt, and grind gradually with water into a thick paste.  

8. 🍳 For tempering: Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds, urad dal, curry leaves, and a pinch of asafoetida. Once they splutter, pour this tempering over the ground thogayal and mix well.
