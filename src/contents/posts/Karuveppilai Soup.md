# 🌿 Karuveppilai Soup | Curry Leaves Soup  

✨ **“A wholesome, peppery soup where aromatic curry leaves meet protein-rich moong dal — soothing and healthy!”**  

🌿 Curry Leaves (Karuveppilai) are an inseparable part of South Indian cooking — not just for their aroma, but also for their incredible health benefits. 
Rich in antioxidants, iron, and vitamins, curry leaves aid digestion, improve hair and skin health, and help detoxify the body. 
Traditionally, they are seen as both a flavor enhancer and a natural medicine — which is why elders always say “Don’t throw away the curry leaves from your food!”

When used in this soup, curry leaves release their natural oils and blend beautifully with moong dal and pepper, creating a dish that’s both healing and delicious.
