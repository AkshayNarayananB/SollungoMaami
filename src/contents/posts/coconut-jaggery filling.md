## 🌾 Ingredients

-  1 cup water  
-  1 tsp cardamom powder  
-  1 tsp ghee

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Jaggery Syrup  
1.  In a kadai, combine jaggery and water. Mix well.  
2.  Cook on medium flame for 5-10 minutes until jaggery dissolves fully.  
💡 Tip: Use good quality jaggery with natural syrup for juicy, flavorful stuffing.  
3.  Wait for jaggery to begin boiling slightly before next step.  

### Step 2: Add the Coconut  
1.  Add grated coconut to boiling jaggery syrup and mix well.  
2.  Initially, they will look separate; keep stirring on medium flame for 2-3 minutes.  
3.  The mixture will gradually blend together.  

### Step 3: Cook the Mixture  
1.  Boil for 5-10 minutes allowing coconut to cook well in jaggery.  
2.  Keep stirring continuously to prevent sticking and burning.  
3.  Coconut will absorb water and thicken.  

### Step 4: Final Seasoning  
1.  Add cardamom powder and mix thoroughly without stopping.  
2.  Continue mixing for 2-3 minutes until syrup is absorbed.  
3.  Add ghee and mix for another 2 minutes for richness.  

### Step 5: Check for Doneness  
1.  Dip hand in water, try rolling small portion into a ball.  
2.  If it forms a smooth round ball easily, stuffing is ready.  
3.  If not, cook 1-2 more minutes but avoid overcooking.  
4.  Mixture should not stick to pan and should roll well.  

### Step 6: Cool and Shape  
1.  Let stuffing cool completely.  
2.  Roll into small balls and keep aside.  
3.  Shape just before stuffing Kozhukattai — stuffing hardens if left too long.
