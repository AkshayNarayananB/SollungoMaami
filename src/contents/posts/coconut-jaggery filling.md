## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Jaggery Syrup  
🍯 In a kadai, combine jaggery and water. Mix well.  
🔥 Cook on medium flame for 5-10 minutes until jaggery dissolves fully.  
💡 Tip: Use good quality jaggery with natural syrup for juicy, flavorful stuffing.  
⏰ Wait for jaggery to begin boiling slightly before next step.  

### Step 2: Add the Coconut  
🥥 Add grated coconut to boiling jaggery syrup and mix well.  
🔥 Initially, they will look separate; keep stirring on medium flame for 2-3 minutes.  
🥄 The mixture will gradually blend together.  

### Step 3: Cook the Mixture  
⏰ Boil for 5-10 minutes allowing coconut to cook well in jaggery.  
🥄 Keep stirring continuously to prevent sticking and burning.  
👀 Coconut will absorb water and thicken.  

### Step 4: Final Seasoning  
🌿 Add cardamom powder and mix thoroughly without stopping.  
⏰ Continue mixing for 2-3 minutes until syrup is absorbed.  
🧈 Add ghee and mix for another 2 minutes for richness.  

### Step 5: Check for Doneness  
🏀 Dip hand in water, try rolling small portion into a ball.  
✅ If it forms a smooth round ball easily, stuffing is ready.  
🔥 If not, cook 1-2 more minutes but avoid overcooking.  
👀 Mixture should not stick to pan and should roll well.  

### Step 6: Cool and Shape  
❄️ Let stuffing cool completely.  
🏀 Roll into small balls and keep aside.  
⚠️ Shape just before stuffing Kozhukattai — stuffing hardens if left too long.
