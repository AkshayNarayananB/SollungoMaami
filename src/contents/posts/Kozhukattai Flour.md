- 2-3 tsp sesame oil

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Flour Mixture  
- In a bowl, combine rice flour and salt. Mix well.  
- Gradually add water little by little while continuously mixing. Use a hand blender for smoother mixing if available.  
- Aim for a dosa batter-like consistency. Do **not** add all the water at once.  

### Step 2: Cook the Batter  
- In a heavy-bottomed kadai or pan, add the sesame oil first.  
- Immediately pour in the rice flour batter. Mix the oil and batter well.  
- **Do not switch on the flame yet** — if the oil becomes even slightly warm, the batter will start forming lumps.  
- Once oil and batter are combined smoothly, switch on the flame to **medium-low** and keep stirring continuously.  
- At first, oil may gather at the corners — this is normal. Continue mixing until the batter thickens into a soft dough.  

### Step 3: Continuous Mixing  
- Keep stirring without pause for about 5 minutes on medium flame.  
- The batter will thicken gradually. Scrape flour stuck on sides back into the batter.  
- Do **not** stop stirring or the batter will become crispy and unusable for Kozhukattai.  

### Step 4: Final Cooking  
- Continue stirring for another 2 minutes until the batter is well-cooked and thick.  
- Test readiness: take a small portion, if it doesn’t stick to your palms, it’s ready.  
- If sticky, cook 2–3 more minutes while stirring.  

### Step 5: Storage  
- Transfer batter immediately to another vessel.  
- Cover tightly to prevent drying out. Uncovered batter dries and becomes hard to shape.
