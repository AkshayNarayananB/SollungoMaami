## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Flour Mixture  
🥣 In a bowl, combine rice flour and salt. Mix well.  
💧 Gradually add water little by little while continuously mixing. Use a hand blender for smoother mixing if available.  
🥄 Aim for a dosa batter-like consistency. Do **not** add all the water at once.  

### Step 2: Cook the Batter  
🔥 Heat sesame oil in a heavy-bottomed kadai or pan.  
⚠️ Add the rice flour mixture as soon as the oil heats (do not let oil get too hot).  
🥄 Immediately start mixing. Initially, oil may gather at corners — this is normal.  

### Step 3: Continuous Mixing  
⏰ Keep stirring without pause for about 5 minutes on medium flame.  
🔥 The batter will thicken gradually. Scrape flour stuck on sides back into the batter.  
⚠️ Do **not** stop stirring or the batter will become crispy and unusable for Kozhukattai.  

### Step 4: Final Cooking  
⏰ Continue stirring for another 2 minutes until the batter is well-cooked and thick.  
✋ Test readiness: take a small portion, if it doesn’t stick to your palms, it’s ready.  
🔥 If sticky, cook 2–3 more minutes while stirring.  

### Step 5: Storage  
🫙 Transfer batter immediately to another vessel.  
🔒 Cover tightly to prevent drying out. Uncovered batter dries and becomes hard to shape.

## ✅ Tips for Success

- 🔥 Maintain medium flame throughout cooking.  
- ⏰ Never stop stirring while cooking.

- 🫙 Store batter covered to keep moisture intact.
