## 👩‍🍳 Preparation Steps

### 1️⃣ Prepare the Besan Flour
- Sieve besan flour through a fine strainer to remove lumps for a smooth texture.  
- Flour should be fine and flowing.  

### 2️⃣ Lightly Roast the Besan
- Heat kadai on medium-low flame.  
- Add sieved besan and roast for 1–2 minutes until slightly warm (do not change color).  
- Remove and set aside.  

### 3️⃣ Prepare Sugar Syrup
- In the same kadai, add sugar and water.  
- Boil on medium high flame until it reaches one-string consistency (test by touching syrup between thumb and finger — it should form a string).  
- Reduce to low flame once reached.  

### 4️⃣ Heat the Ghee
- On a separate stove, heat ghee on low flame and keep melted and ready.

## 🍲 Making the Mysore Pak

### 5️⃣ Combine Besan with Sugar Syrup
- Slowly add roasted besan to sugar syrup.  
- Stir continuously until smooth and flowing, removing any lumps at the bottom.  

### 6️⃣ Add Ghee Gradually
- Add ghee in 2–3 ladlefuls at a time, stirring continuously.  
- Wait for the mixture to absorb ghee before adding more.  
- This takes about 8–10 minutes on medium-low flame.  

### 7️⃣ Recognize the Final Stage
- Mixture will thicken, start to leave the sides of the pan, and begin spluttering.  
- Switch off stove immediately.  

### 8️⃣ Setting the Mysore Pak
- Pour hot mixture onto a greased plate.  
- Level quickly with ladle.  
- Sprinkle some sugar on top.  
- Let rest for 5 minutes.  

### 9️⃣ Cutting
- Cut while warm using a butter knife (not sharp).  
- Wait 10–15 minutes after cutting before removing pieces.  
- Avoid cutting too early or too late for best results.
