## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparing the Stuffing:  
1. Dry roast the peanuts in a pan on medium flame until golden. Set aside.  
2. Roast sesame seeds in the same pan for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  
3. Add grated coconut, ginger, and garlic; roast for 5-10 minutes until coconut turns light brown.  
4. Mix in jaggery and let it splutter for a minute.  
5. Add red chilies and roast for 2 minutes. Turn off heat and let cool.  
6. Grind roasted peanuts and 1 onion with the cooled mixture into a fine paste, adding minimal water.

### Preparing the Brinjals:  
1. Prepare salted water in a vessel.  
2. Make a cross-cut from the bottom of each brinjal, keeping the stem intact so it opens like a flower but stays connected at the top.  
3. Soak the cut brinjals in salted water to prevent discoloration.  
4. Remove and pat dry. Stuff each brinjal generously with the prepared paste.

### Cooking the Curry:  
1. Heat 2-3 tbsp oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.  
2. Sauté chopped onions until light brown.  
3. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until mushy.  
4. Season with salt, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and hing. Mix well.  
5. Add any leftover stuffing paste and combine.  
6. Gently add stuffed brinjals to the pan, mix carefully to avoid breaking.  
7. Cover and cook for 2-3 minutes; then open and stir gently.  
8. Add water if needed, cover again and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  
9. When gravy thickens, bubbling reduces, and oil separates, turn off heat.  
10. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves.
