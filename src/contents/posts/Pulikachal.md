## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Tamarind
1. Soak tamarind in water and extract the pulp. Set aside.

### Step 2: Dry Roast Spices
1. Dry roast coriander seeds until aromatic; keep aside.  
2. Dry roast red chilies and set aside.  
3. Dry roast fenugreek seeds until brown and pop. Keep aside.  
4. Reserve ½ tsp roasted fenugreek seeds separately for later use.  
5. Allow all roasted ingredients to cool to room temperature, then grind to a fine powder.

### Step 3: Cook Tamarind Paste
1. Heat sesame oil in a kadai generously.  
2. Add mustard seeds; once they splutter, add hing and chana dal, and roast for a minute.  
3. Add peanuts and roast well.  
4. Add turmeric powder, curry leaves, and 4–5 dry red chilies; roast for a minute.  
5. Add tamarind pulp along with the reserved roasted fenugreek seeds.  
6. Add salt and cook on high flame until tamarind water starts boiling.  
7. Reduce to medium-low flame and cook 5–10 minutes until raw smell disappears.

### Step 4: Finish with Masala
1. Add the ground masala powder and mix well.  
2. Cook on medium-low flame for 20–30 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent burning.  
3. Once thick and oil separates on top, reduce to low flame for 2–3 minutes.  
4. Turn off the flame and let it cool.

### Step 5: Mixing Rice with Pulikachal
1. Mixing Rice with Pulikachal
2. Cook rice (preferably raw rice / sona masoori) until soft and fluffy.
3. Spread the hot rice on a wide plate or vessel, drizzle a little sesame oil (to avoid sticking).
4. Add 2–3 spoons of Pulikachal (tamarind paste mix) over the rice.
5. Gently mix with a flat spoon or your hand (once rice cools slightly), ensuring the paste coats every grain evenly.
6. Taste and adjust by adding more Pulikachal or oil if needed.
