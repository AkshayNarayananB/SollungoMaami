## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparing the Rice-Coconut Base  
 **Soak rice:** Clean and soak raw rice in water for 30 minutes.  
 **Drain and prepare:** Drain water completely from soaked rice.  
 **Grind mixture:** Blend soaked rice and grated coconut with little water to a smooth, thick but pourable paste. Optionally strain for extra smoothness.

### Cooking the Payasam  
 **Dilute paste:** Transfer to a heavy pan, add 2–2.5 cups water, mix to milk-like consistency.  
 **Cook:** On medium-low heat, stirring continuously for about 5 minutes until smooth and cooked.  
 **Add jaggery:** Stir in jaggery and let it melt completely on low flame (~5 minutes).  
 **Add spices:** Mix in cardamom powder and optional saffron. Simmer 2–3 minutes.

### Preparing the Garnish  
 **Heat ghee:** In a small pan, heat ghee over medium heat.  
 **Fry cashews:** Until golden red.  
 **Add to payasam:** Add cashews with ghee to the payasam and mix well.  

### Final Touch  
 Turn off heat; let payasam cool 5 minutes.  
 Add boiled milk and stir gently. Adjust consistency if needed.  
 Let rest 10–15 minutes before serving.
