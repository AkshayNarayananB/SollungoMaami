## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparing the Dough  
**Mix wet ingredients:** Combine curd, ghee, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl.  
**Add maida:** Gradually mix in using hands until dough forms.  
**Knead:** For a few minutes until smooth and soft.  
**Rest:** Cover dough and set aside for 30 minutes.

### Preparing the Sugar Syrup  
In a pan, combine sugar and water.  
Heat on medium, stirring until sugar dissolves.  
Boil for about 5 minutes until slightly sticky (one-string consistency).  
Turn off heat; add cardamom powder and lemon juice. Mix and set aside.

### Shaping the Badusha  
Knead dough again until smooth and pliable.  
Divide dough into small portions.  
Roll each into a ball and flatten into a disc.  
Using thumb, press a hole in the center to form classic Badusha shape.  

### Frying the Badusha  
Heat oil in a deep pan on medium heat (warm, not hot).  
Test oil with small dough piece – should sink then slowly rise.  
Fry shaped Badushas gently; they sink initially.  
Cook on medium flame, stirring gently, until they rise and turn golden brown (~4–5 mins).  
Flip carefully for even frying.

### Soaking in Syrup  
Warm sugar syrup if cooled.  
Immediately soak hot fried Badushas in warm syrup.  
Turn after 1 minute to soak both sides.  
Let soak for 2–3 minutes until syrup is absorbed.
