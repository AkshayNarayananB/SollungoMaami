## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparing the Dough  
# 1️⃣ Mix wet ingredients: Combine curd, ghee, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl.  
# 2️⃣ Add maida gradually and mix using hands until dough forms.  
# 3️⃣ Knead dough for a few minutes until smooth and soft.  
# 4️⃣ Rest dough covered for 30 minutes.

### Preparing the Sugar Syrup  
# 5️⃣ In a pan, combine sugar and water.  
# 6️⃣ Heat on medium, stirring until sugar dissolves.  
# 7️⃣ Boil for about 5 minutes until slightly sticky (one-string consistency).  
# 8️⃣ Turn off heat; add cardamom powder and lemon juice. Mix and set aside.

### Shaping the Badusha  
# 9️⃣ Knead dough again until smooth and pliable.  
# 🔟 Divide dough into small portions (size per preference).  
# 1️⃣1️⃣ Roll each into a ball and flatten into a disc.  
# 1️⃣2️⃣ Using thumb, press a hole in the center to form classic Badusha shape.  

### Frying the Badusha  
# 1️⃣3️⃣ Heat oil in a deep pan on medium heat (warm, not hot).  
# 1️⃣4️⃣ Test oil by dropping a small dough piece – should sink then slowly rise.  
# 1️⃣5️⃣ Fry shaped Badushas gently; they sink initially.  
# 1️⃣6️⃣ Cook on medium flame, stirring gently, until they rise and turn golden brown (~4-5 mins).  
# 1️⃣7️⃣ Flip carefully for even frying.

### Soaking in Syrup  
# 1️⃣8️⃣ Warm sugar syrup if cooled.  
# 1️⃣9️⃣ Immediately soak hot fried Badushas in warm syrup.  
# 2️⃣0️⃣ Turn after 1 minute to soak both sides.  
# 2️⃣1️⃣ Let soak for 2-3 minutes until syrup is absorbed and Badusha softens.
