## 💡 Tips for Best Texture

- Grind batter slightly coarse  
- Cook on **medium-low heat** for crisp edges  
- Batter too thick? Add just **1-2 tsp water**  
- **Add salt only before making chillas**  
  > Salt draws water from batter & veggies — adding at the end keeps batter thick & prevents soggy chillas  
- Keep topping curd chilled for best taste
