## 📝 Ingredients

🧂 Salt – to taste

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. **Prepare the Tomato Pulp:**  
   Roughly chop the tomatoes and grind into a smooth pulp without adding water.

2. **Temper the Oil:**  
   Heat sesame oil in a heavy-bottomed kadai. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add a pinch of hing.

3. **Add Tomato Pulp:**  
   Pour in the tomato pulp, stir well, and keep flame on medium-low.

4. **Add Seasonings:**  
   Add salt and sambar powder. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the powder into the tomato base.

5. **Cook Covered:**  
   Cook on medium flame. After 5 minutes, a frothy layer will form on top.

6. **Cover to Avoid Splatter:**  
   Cover partially or fully to control splattering. Stir every 5 minutes, lowering flame to avoid burning.

7. **Slow Cook Until Thick:**  
   After 20–25 minutes, the thokku will thicken, reduce in volume, and oil will separate and float on top.

8. **Final Stir & Finish:**  
   Stir for 2 more minutes, turn off flame once spluttering reduces and mixture thickens. Let cool.
