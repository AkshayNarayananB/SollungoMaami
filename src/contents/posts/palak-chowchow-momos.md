## 👩‍🍳 Instructions  

### 1. Prepare Palak Puree  
- Wash palak thoroughly and boil in water for **1–2 minutes**.  
- Immediately transfer to cold water to retain the bright green color.  
- Drain and grind to a smooth puree.  

### 2. Make Palak Dough  
- In a mixing bowl, add **1 cup wheat flour** and **salt**.  
- Add **palak puree** gradually and knead into a soft dough.  
- Add water only if required and rest for **15–20 minutes**.  

### 3. Make Regular Wheat Dough  
- In another bowl, mix **wheat flour** and **salt**.  
- Add water little by little to make a smooth dough.  
- Rest for 15 minutes.  

### 4. Prepare the Stuffing  
- In a bowl, mix **grated chow chow** and **carrot**.  
- Let it rest for 10–15 minutes — they will release water.  
- Squeeze out excess water completely.  
- Add **onion**, **green chili**, **coriander leaves**, **salt**, and **crushed pepper**.  
- Pour **2 tsp of hot oil** and mix everything well.  

### 5. Shape the Momos  
- Take a small portion of both **palak** and **wheat dough**.  
- Flatten the wheat dough slightly and place the palak dough in the center.  
- Roll them together into a log and cut into small pieces.  
- Roll each piece into a thin circle — you’ll see a nice green-white swirl.  
- Place a spoonful of stuffing in the center.  
- Fold and seal the edges to form a crescent, then join both corners for the momo shape.  

### 6. Steam the Momos  
- Grease a steamer plate lightly with oil.  
- Place the momos and steam for **15–20 minutes** on medium flame.  
- Once cooked, brush lightly with oil for a glossy look.
