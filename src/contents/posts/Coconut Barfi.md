## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparation  
 Grease a plate or tray with ghee and set aside.  
 Chop roasted cashews into small pieces.  
 Keep all ingredients ready as the process moves quickly.  

### Making the Sugar Syrup  
 In a heavy-bottomed pan, add sugar and cook on medium heat.  
 Stir continuously until sugar melts and forms a thick syrup (soft ball stage).  

### Adding Coconut  
 Add grated coconut to hot sugar syrup.  
 Reduce heat to medium-low.  
 Stir continuously and cook for 2–3 minutes until boiling.  
 Continue stirring as mixture thickens.  

### Flavoring and Final Cooking  
 Add cardamom powder and mix well.  
 Increase heat to medium and stir for 5 minutes until mixture thickens and leaves sides of pan.  
 Add roasted cashews and mix well.  

### Setting the Barfi  
 Keep stirring continuously as mixture can splutter.  
 When mixture thickens and leaves pan sides, turn off heat.  
 Immediately transfer to greased plate.  
 Level quickly with ladle/spatula and press gently to even out.  

### Cutting  
 Cut while warm using a sharp knife for neat shapes.  
 Cutting cold barfi may cause breakage.
