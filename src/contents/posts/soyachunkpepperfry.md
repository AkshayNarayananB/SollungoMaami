## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Cook the Soya Chunks**  
   - In a kadai, bring 5–6 cups of water to a boil with a little salt.  
   - Add soya chunks and cook for about 5 minutes until they double in size.  
   - Switch off the flame, strain, and soak the cooked chunks in fresh water for 1–2 minutes.  
   - Wash thoroughly and squeeze out all excess water.  
   👉 This step is crucial — only when fully squeezed can soya absorb the masala flavors.  

2. **Prepare the Masala Base**  
   - Heat oil in a kadai. Add fennel seeds and green chilies, saute briefly.  
   - Add finely chopped onions and fry until translucent.  
   - Add ginger garlic paste and saute until raw smell disappears.  
   - Add chopped tomatoes and cook until mushy.  

3. **Spice It Up**  
   - Add cumin powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, hing, and salt.  
   - Mix well and cook for about 5 minutes until tomatoes release oil.  
   - (Cover if needed for faster cooking.)  

4. **Add Soya Chunks**  
   - Add the squeezed soya chunks to the masala.  
   - Sprinkle pepper powder, toss everything together.
   - Mix well and cook on medium-low flame without covering for 5 minutes.  

5. **Finish**  
   - Add chopped coriander leaves, mix well, and switch off the flame.

## 🌟 Tips
