#  Sabudana Khichdi Recipe | Non-Sticky & Protein-Rich  

“✨ A light, flavour-packed khichdi made with steamed sabudana, roasted peanuts, potatoes, and simple spices. Each pearl stays separate, soft, and perfectly cooked — a wholesome meal for breakfast or fasting days! ✨”

Sabudana Khichdi is a popular Indian tiffin and vrat (fasting) special made using **soaked sabudana, peanuts, potatoes, cumin, and fresh coriander**.  
In this method, the sabudana is **steamed** instead of being cooked directly, which keeps every pearl separate, non-sticky, and fluffy. Roasted peanut powder coats each grain, giving a beautiful texture and nutty taste.  
This khichdi is comforting, nutritious, gluten-free, and pairs wonderfully with curd.
