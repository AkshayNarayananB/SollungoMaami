# 🌱 Pesarattu | Andhra Green Moong Dal Dosa  

A protein-rich Andhra breakfast classic made with green moong dal — crispy, wholesome, and naturally gluten-free!  

---

When it comes to wholesome South Indian breakfasts, **Pesarattu** (Green Moong Dal Dosa) holds a special place in Andhra cuisine. Made with soaked green gram and flavored with ginger, chilies, and fresh coriander, this dosa is not just delicious but also **naturally gluten-free and protein-rich**.  

Unlike regular dosa, it requires **no fermentation**, making it quick and easy to prepare.  

For an authentic Andhra touch, try the famous **MLA Pesarattu** — stuffed with hot rava upma, similar to masala dosa but healthier and even more filling!
