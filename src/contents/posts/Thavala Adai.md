# 🥥 Thavala Adai | Traditional South Indian Spiced Rice-Lentil Pancake  

✨ A crispy, golden, and wholesome South Indian tiffin — crunchy outside, soft inside, and bursting with traditional flavors! ✨  

---

**Thavala Adai** is a classic South Indian dish deeply rooted in Tamil Brahmin households, often made as a hearty evening tiffin or festive special. With coarsely ground rice and lentils spiced with black pepper, curry leaves, and hing, it beautifully blends the **comfort of upma with the crunch of adai**.  

Traditionally, the mixture is first cooked like a thick upma, then shaped into patties and roasted until golden brown. Each bite offers **earthy spices, nuttiness from coconut, and richness of ghee**, making this dish both nourishing and satisfying.
