## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Base  
-  Wash rice and urad dal thoroughly.  
-  Soak together for 1 hour.  
-  Drain completely.  

### Step 2: Grind the Batter  
-  Grind rice and dal to a thick paste in mixer.  
-  Add salt while grinding.  
-  Use minimal water (1 tbsp max) to keep batter thick — crucial for crispiness.  

### Step 3: Season and Rest  
-  Mix in chopped ginger, green chillies, curry leaves, and crushed black pepper.  
-  Add thick curd, mix well.  
-  Let batter rest — prepare in morning for evening frying or night before for morning.  
-  Cover and set aside to ferment and develop flavor.  

### Step 4: Prepare Tempering  
-  Heat ghee in small pan.  
-  Add mustard seeds; let splutter.  
-  Add urad dal; fry golden.  
-  Add asafoetida; fry few seconds.  
-  Pour tempering into rested batter and mix well.  

### Step 5: Frying Process  
-  Heat oil for deep frying.  
-  Stir batter well before each use.  
-  Drop ladlefuls of batter directly into hot oil (no shaping).  
-  Pour hot oil over the appams while frying for quick, even cooking and extra crispiness.  

### Step 6: Perfect the Cooking  
-  Flip appams when bottom is golden brown.  
-  Keep turning until both sides are evenly golden and crispy.  
-  Remove and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
