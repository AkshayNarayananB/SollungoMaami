### Step 2: Grind the Batter

### Step 4: Prepare Tempering

- 🧄 Add asafoetida; fry few seconds.  
- 🥄 Pour tempering into rested batter and mix well.  

### Step 5: Frying Process  
- 🔥 Heat oil for deep frying.  
- 🥄 Stir batter well before each use.  
- 🌊 Drop ladlefuls of batter directly into hot oil (no shaping).  
- 🥄 Pour hot oil over the appams while frying for quick, even cooking and extra crispiness.  

### Step 6: Perfect the Cooking  
- 🔄 Flip appams when bottom is golden brown.  
- ⏱️ Keep turning until both sides are evenly golden and crispy.  
- 🌟 Remove and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
