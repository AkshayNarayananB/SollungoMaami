### Step 2: Grind the Batter  
- 🔄 Grind rice and dal to a thick paste in mixer.

### Step 3: Season and Rest  
- 🫚 Mix in chopped ginger, green chillies, curry leaves, and crushed black pepper.  
- 🥛 Add thick curd, mix well.  
- 🕐 Let batter rest — prepare in morning for evening frying or night before for morning.  
- 📦 Cover and set aside to ferment and develop flavor.  

### Step 4: Prepare Tempering  
- 🧈 Heat ghee in small pan.  
- 🌿 Add mustard seeds; let splutter.  
- 🌾 Add urad dal; fry golden.  
- 🧄 Add asafoetida; fry few seconds.  
- 🥄 Pour tempering into rested batter and mix well.  

### Step 5: Frying Process  
- 🔥 Heat oil for deep frying.  
- 🥄 Stir batter well before each use.  
- 🌊 Drop ladlefuls of batter directly into hot oil (no shaping).  
- 🥄 Pour hot oil over the appams while frying for quick, even cooking and extra crispiness.  

### Step 6: Perfect the Cooking  
- 🔄 Flip appams when bottom is golden brown.  
- ⏱️ Keep turning until both sides are evenly golden and crispy.  
- 🌟 Remove and drain on paper towels to absorb excess oil.
