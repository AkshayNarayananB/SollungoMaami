# 🍚 Godhuma Rava Akkaravadisal | Wheat Semolina Sweet

A rich, traditional South Indian sweet perfect for festivals and special occasions.

Akkaravadisal is a beloved South Indian sweet traditionally made with rice, but this **wheat rava** (broken wheat/semolina) version is equally delicious and nutritious. The key is cooking the wheat semolina entirely in milk, giving it incredible richness and a unique taste that makes it truly special.

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparing the Wheat Rava  
# 1️⃣ Choose finely ground wheat rava (similar to semolina); coarse rava is not suitable.  
# 2️⃣ Heat 1½ tbsp ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.  
# 3️⃣ Add wheat rava and roast well until a pleasant nutty aroma emerges.  

### Cooking in Milk  
# 4️⃣ Add 1 cup milk gradually to the roasted rava; mix well to avoid lumps.  
# 5️⃣ Cook on medium flame, stirring continuously until it begins to boil (~5 mins).  
# 6️⃣ Add more milk as needed (approx. 5-6 cups total) to keep cooking rava thoroughly soft.  
# 7️⃣ Continue cooking for 15-20 minutes until fully cooked and smooth.  

### Adding Sweetness and Flavor  
# 8️⃣ Add jaggery equal in quantity to the rava.  
# 9️⃣ Stir and let jaggery melt completely, stirring occasionally.  
# 🔟 Add 2 tbsp ghee and mix well.  
# 1️⃣1️⃣ Cook on medium heat, stirring regularly.  
# 1️⃣2️⃣ When mixture boils again, add cardamom powder and stir.  
# 1️⃣3️⃣ Cook 2-3 more minutes stirring continuously.  

### Preparing the Garnish  
# 1️⃣4️⃣ Heat 1 tsp ghee in a small pan.  
# 1️⃣5️⃣ Fry cashew nuts until golden red.  
# 1️⃣6️⃣ Add fried cashews with ghee to the sweet and mix well.  
# 1️⃣7️⃣ Cook 2-3 more minutes, then turn off heat.  
# 1️⃣8️⃣ Optionally add a pinch of pachha karpooram and mix gently.
