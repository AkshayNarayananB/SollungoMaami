# 🍚 Godhuma Rava Akkaravadisal | Wheat Semolina Sweet

A rich, traditional South Indian sweet perfect for festivals and special occasions.

Akkaravadisal is a beloved South Indian sweet traditionally made with rice, but this **wheat rava** (broken wheat/semolina) version is equally delicious and nutritious. The key is cooking the wheat semolina entirely in milk, giving it incredible richness and a unique taste that makes it truly special.

## ✨ Ingredients

- 🌾 Godhuma rava (wheat semolina/broken wheat) – ½ cup  
- 🥛 Milk – 3 cups (or more as needed)  
- 🧈 Ghee – 3 to 4 tbsp  
- 🍬 Jaggery (powdered or small pieces) – ½ cup

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Preparing the Wheat Rava  
 Choose finely ground wheat rava (similar to semolina); coarse rava is not suitable.  
 Heat 1½ tbsp ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat.  
 Add wheat rava and roast well until a pleasant nutty aroma emerges.  

### Cooking in Milk  
 Add 1 cup milk gradually to the roasted rava; mix well to avoid lumps.  
 Cook on medium flame, stirring continuously until it begins to boil (~5 mins).  
 Add more milk as needed (approx. 5–6 cups total) to keep cooking rava thoroughly soft.  
 Continue cooking for 15–20 minutes until fully cooked and smooth.  

### Adding Sweetness and Flavor  
 Add jaggery equal in quantity to the rava.  
 Stir and let jaggery melt completely, stirring occasionally.  
 Add 2 tbsp ghee and mix well.  
 Cook on medium heat, stirring regularly.  
 When mixture boils again, add cardamom powder and stir.  
 Cook 2–3 more minutes, stirring continuously.  

### Preparing the Garnish  
 Heat 1 tsp ghee in a small pan.  
 Fry cashew nuts until golden red.  
 Add fried cashews with ghee to the sweet and mix well.  
 Cook 2–3 more minutes, then turn off heat.  
 Optionally add a pinch of pachha karpooram and mix gently.
