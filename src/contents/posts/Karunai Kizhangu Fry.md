# Karunai Kizhangu Fry | Elephant Yam Roast

✨ **“Crispy on the outside, soft inside — yam never tasted this good!”**


✨ In many Tamil homes, Karunai Kizhangu Fry is more than just a side dish — it’s a nostalgic comfort food.
The yam is first softened in tamarind water to remove its natural itchiness, then coated in a spicy masala, and finally roasted to perfection on a tawa.
The result? Crispy golden pieces on the outside, soft and flavorful inside — the kind of dish that disappears fast the moment it’s served!

It’s usually enjoyed with sambar rice, rasam rice, or even curd rice, adding a crunchy, tangy-spicy bite to the meal. For many, this fry brings back memories of Sunday lunches at home with the family.

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Prepare the Yam**
   - Peel and wash the yam. Cut into long, thick pieces.  
   - Soak tamarind in water and extract the pulp.  
   - In a kadai, add tamarind water, yam, and a little salt. Cook until just tender.  
   ⚠️ Do not overcook — yam should hold its shape. Drain and keep aside.

2. **Prepare the Masala**
   - Grind onions and fennel seeds into a coarse paste (no water).  
   - In a mixing bowl, combine this paste with sambar powder, curry leaves, hing, and salt. Mix well.  
   - Add the cooked yam and coat each piece thoroughly. Rest for 20–25 minutes.

3. **Roast the Yam**
   - Heat a dosa tawa and drizzle oil.  
   - Mix the yam once again before roasting to coat with masala.  
   - Place yam pieces on the hot tawa, leaving space for flipping.  
   - Add ½ tsp oil on each piece. Roast until golden and crisp on one side, then flip and roast the other side.
