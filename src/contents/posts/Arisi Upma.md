# 🍚 Arisi Upma Recipe | Traditional Rice Upma in Vengala Panai

“Traditional, tasty, and wholesome — Arisi Upma cooked the authentic way!”

**Arisi Upma** is a humble yet beloved dish from Tamil cuisine, made from coarsely ground raw rice and toor dal. When cooked in a **vengala panai** (bronze pot), it develops a deep flavor and a mildly crispy bottom layer — a cherished texture in many Tamil homes.

Simple spices, grated coconut, and a final drizzle of ghee elevate this dish from everyday to soul-satisfying.

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Grind the Base**  
   Add raw rice, toor dal, and black pepper to a dry mixer jar.  
   Pulse to a coarse texture — like rava or fine upma rava.

2. **Prepare the Pan**  
   Use a **vengala panai** or heavy-bottomed vessel.  
   Heat 2–3 tbsp oil.

3. **Tempering**  
   Once hot, add mustard seeds and let them splutter.  
   Then add urad dal (if using), hing, curry leaves, and dry red chilies or Mor Milagai.  
   🔸 *If using Mor Milagai, fry them **first** before mustard seeds — they need longer cooking.*

4. **Add Water & Coconut**  
   Pour in the measured water. Add grated coconut and salt.  
   Bring to a rolling boil.

5. **Add Ground Powder**  
   Lower the flame. Slowly add the ground rice-dal mixture while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.

6. **Cook & Cover**  
   Keep stirring until the mixture thickens slightly.  
   Cover with a **flat lid**, and place a bowl of water on top (traditional **dum** method).

7. **Stir Occasionally**  
   Every 2–3 minutes, open the lid, stir the upma to prevent sticking, and cover again.  
   Cook this way for **10–12 minutes on low flame**.

8. **Finish with Ghee**  
   Add a spoon of ghee at the end. Stir gently. Serve hot.

## 🌟 Tips & Variations

- 🛢️ **Coconut oil** adds a fragrant, traditional touch — use it instead of sunflower oil for more flavor.  
- 🧈 A final spoon of **ghee** brings richness and aroma.  
- 🔥 For a **crispy bottom layer**, continue cooking on low for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  
- 🧂 **Mor Milagai** already contains salt — reduce added salt accordingly.  
- 💧 Keep a little extra hot water on hand — you can add it if the mixture thickens too quickly.
