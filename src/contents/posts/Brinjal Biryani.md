## 👩‍🍳 Method

### **Step 1: Prepare the Masala Paste**
1. Add tomato, onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, clove, cinnamon, star anise, fennel, turmeric, red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala, mint and coriander leaves to a mixer.  
2. Grind into a smooth paste using very little water.

---

### **Step 2: Marinate the Brinjals**
1. Add the ground masala to a bowl and mix in curd and salt.  
2. Add slit brinjals and coat well, ensuring masala gets inside the cuts.  
3. Rest for **30 minutes**.

---

### **Step 3: Cook the Brinjal Masala**
1. Heat sesame oil in a heavy-bottomed pan.  
2. Add whole spices and chopped onions.  
3. Saute until onions turn **golden brown & slightly crispy**.  
4. Add marinated brinjals along with the masala.  
5. Cook covered until brinjals soften and oil begins to release.  
6. Add more mint & coriander leaves and adjust salt.

---

### **Step 4: Cook Rice (75–80% done)**
1. Cook soaked basmati rice with fresh water, salt, and a few mint leaves.  
2. Stop when the rice is **80% cooked** – soft outside, slightly firm inside.

---

### **Step 5: Layer the Briyani**
1. Add partially cooked rice to the brinjal mixture gently using a ladle so some rice water goes in.  
2. Spread evenly without pressing.  
3. Drizzle saffron milk.  
4. Add extra mint and coriander leaves.  
5. Check moisture — a little water at the bottom ensures perfect dum.

---

### **Step 6: Dum Cooking**
1. Place the briyani pot over a dosa tawa.  
2. Cover tightly and place weight over the lid.  
3. Cook on **low flame for 20–25 minutes**.  
4. Open and fluff gently. Rice should be fully cooked with no extra moisture.

## 💡 Tips

- Brinjals must be slit but stem intact to hold shape.  
- Avoid adding too much water to masala — brinjals cook best in thick gravy.  
- Cook rice only till 75–80% before layering.  
- Dum on tawa gives the best restaurant-style aroma.  
- Use sesame oil for the most authentic flavour.
