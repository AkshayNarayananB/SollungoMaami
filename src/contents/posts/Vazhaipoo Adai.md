## 🌟 Tips & Notes  

- **Rice Variation** – For thicker and crispier adai, increase rice from ½ cup to **1 full cup** while soaking.  
- **Coarse Batter** – Do not grind too smooth; coarse texture gives better taste.  
- **Banana Flower Prep** – Remove the stamen and calyx while cleaning to avoid bitterness.  
- **Tawa Heat** – Always ensure tawa is hot before pouring batter for crisp edges.  
- **Oil Drizzle** – Adding oil in the center hole helps cook evenly.

## 🥡 Storage  

- **Batter:** Can be refrigerated for up to **2 days**.  
- **Cooked Adai:** Best served fresh; reheating may reduce crispiness.  
- **Banana Flower:** Once chopped, always cook immediately or keep in buttermilk water to prevent blackening.
