## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. **Prepare Dal & Turnip:**  
   Wash toor dal thoroughly. Add turmeric powder and enough water to pressure cook. Place a flat plate on top of the dal inside the cooker.

2. **Add Turnip for Steaming:**  
   Place chopped turnip in a bowl (no extra water needed). Place this bowl on top of the plate covering the dal. Pressure cook for 3 whistles (~5–10 minutes).

3. **Tempering:**  
   In a heavy-bottomed kadai, heat 2 tbsp gingelly oil. Add 1 tbsp mustard seeds. When they splutter, add chopped green chilies and chopped tomato. Sauté until tomato turns juicy (~2–3 minutes).

4. **Add Curry Leaves & Cooked Turnip:**  
   Add curry leaves. Then add the cooked turnip along with any water released during cooking. Mix well.

5. **Tamarind & Sambar Powder:**  
   Extract tamarind pulp from soaked tamarind. Add this pulp, sambar powder, and salt to the turnip mixture. Cook on medium flame for about 10 minutes until raw tamarind smell disappears.

6. **Add Cooked Dal:**  
   Add the cooked dal to the sambar. Mix thoroughly and check seasoning; add salt if needed.

7. **Final Boil & Garnish:**  
   Bring sambar to a boil for 5 minutes. Turn off the flame and add chopped coriander leaves. Mix gently.
