## 👩‍🍳 Directions

### Prepare Dal & Turnip  
1. Wash toor dal thoroughly. Add turmeric powder and enough water to pressure cook. Place a flat plate inside the cooker on top of the dal.  

2. Place chopped turnip in a bowl (no extra water needed). Put this bowl on the plate inside the cooker. Pressure cook for 3 whistles (~5–10 minutes).

### Tempering  
3. Heat 2 tbsp gingelly oil in a heavy-bottomed kadai. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.  

4. Add chopped green chilies and chopped tomato. Saute until tomatoes turn juicy (~2–3 minutes).

### Add Curry Leaves & Cooked Turnip  
5. Add curry leaves. Then add the cooked turnip along with any cooking water. Mix well.

### Tamarind & Sambar Powder  
6. Extract tamarind pulp from soaked tamarind. Add tamarind pulp, sambar powder, and salt to the turnip mixture. Cook on medium flame for about 10 minutes until the raw tamarind smell disappears.

### Add Cooked Dal  
7. Add cooked dal to the sambar. Mix thoroughly and add salt if needed.

### Final Boil & Garnish  
8. Bring sambar to a boil for 5 minutes. Turn off the flame, add chopped coriander leaves, and mix gently.
