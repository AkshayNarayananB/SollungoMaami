# Kadala Curry Recipe | Classic Kerala Black Chana Curry

“Spice up your mornings with the authentic taste of Kerala’s Kadala Curry!”

Kadala Curry is a traditional Kerala-style black chickpea (black chana) curry, rich in bold spices and creamy coconut gravy. This hearty dish is a beloved staple in Kerala cuisine, commonly enjoyed as a side with breakfast items like puttu, appam, and idiyappam.

Its robust flavors come from a blend of aromatic spices such as cloves, cinnamon, dry red chilies, and freshly grated coconut, ground into a smooth and flavorful paste. The black chickpeas, soaked and pressure-cooked to perfection, absorb these spices beautifully, resulting in a curry that is both comforting and nutritious.
