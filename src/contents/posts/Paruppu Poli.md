## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 🔸 Preparing the Dough:  
1. In a bowl, mix maida, turmeric powder, and salt.  
2. Add water gradually and knead like chapathi dough — it will be sticky.  
3. Add a few spoons of gingelly oil and knead again. Repeat 3-4 times.  
4. Pour 1½ cups gingelly oil over the dough to soak.  
5. Cover and rest for 1 hour to make soft polis.  

### 🔸 Preparing the Stuffing (Puranam):  
1. Dry roast chana dal until light golden and fragrant.  
2. Add water and cook until soft (about 10 mins). Mash to test softness.  
3. Add grated coconut, jaggery, and cardamom powder. Stir till jaggery melts.  
4. Cool the mixture, then grind into a thick, smooth paste with no water.  
5. Shape into lemon-sized balls and set aside.  

### 🔸 Making the Poli:  
1. Grease banana leaf with oil from dough.  
2. Take a small dough ball and spread on the leaf (shape roughly).  
3. Place a stuffing ball in center, cover with dough, and shape into a ball.  
4. Flatten gently into a round poli using fingers and oil as needed.  
5. Heat dosa tawa on medium flame, grease with ghee.  
6. Place banana leaf upside down on tawa, peel leaf slowly to transfer poli.  
7. Cook on medium-low flame for 2-3 mins, flip gently.  
8. Add more ghee, cook until both sides are golden and cooked through.
