## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Clean the Seppankizhangu**  
   Soak yam pieces in water for 10–15 minutes to remove any soil. Rinse thoroughly under running water.

2. **Boil the Yam**  
   Bring water to a boil in a kadai or deep pan. Add yam and cook for 5–10 minutes. Test with a fork — it should pierce easily. Drain and set aside.

3. **Peel & Cut**  
   Let it cool. Peel off the skin and slice into thick round pieces.

4. **Coat with Rice Flour**  
   Add rice flour to the yam slices. Toss to coat evenly. Rest for 5 minutes or refrigerate for 5–10 minutes.

5. **Tempering**  
   Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add mustard seeds and urad dal. Once they splutter and turn golden, add a pinch of hing.

6. **Add & Season the Yam**  
   Add the coated yam slices to the oil. Sprinkle sambar powder and salt. Toss gently to coat the pieces evenly.

7. **Cook Covered**  
   Cover and cook for 2–3 minutes to help spices absorb.

8. **Roast Uncovered**  
   Remove lid. Spread the pieces evenly in the pan. Roast uncovered on medium flame for 10–15 minutes, flipping occasionally until all sides are golden and crisp.

9. **Finish with Ghee**  
   Add 1 tbsp ghee, mix gently. Cover the pan for a minute to retain aroma.
