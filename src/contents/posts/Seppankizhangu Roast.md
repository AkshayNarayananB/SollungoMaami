## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### 1. Clean the Seppankizhangu  
Soak the yam pieces in water for 10–15 minutes to remove soil. Rinse thoroughly under running water.

### 2. Boil the Yam  
Bring water to a boil in a kadai or deep pan. Add yam pieces and cook for 5–10 minutes until fork-tender. Drain and set aside.

### 3. Peel & Cut  
Once cooled, peel off the skin and slice into thick rounds.

### 4. Coat with Rice Flour  
Toss yam slices with rice flour evenly. Rest for 5 minutes or refrigerate for 5–10 minutes.

### 5. Tempering  
Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add mustard seeds and urad dal. When they splutter and turn golden, add a pinch of hing.

### 6. Add & Season the Yam  
Add coated yam slices to the oil. Sprinkle sambar powder and salt. Toss gently to coat.

### 7. Cook Covered  
Cover and cook for 2–3 minutes to absorb spices.

### 8. Roast Uncovered  
Remove lid and roast on medium flame for 10–15 minutes, flipping occasionally until golden and crisp on all sides.

### 9. Finish with Ghee  
Add 1 tbsp ghee, mix gently, cover for a minute to retain aroma.
