# 🎃 Kasi Halwa Recipe | Traditional White Pumpkin Halwa

“Rich, nutty, and melt-in-mouth — that’s the magic of Kasi Halwa!”

Kasi Halwa is a classic South Indian dessert made from white pumpkin (ash gourd), ghee, and sugar, slow-cooked to perfection with aromatic saffron and cardamom. Its silky texture and glossy finish make it a standout on festive spreads and at South Indian weddings.

It’s sweet but not cloying, aromatic without being overpowering, and has a unique taste that wins you over bite after bite.

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Prep the Pumpkin**  
   Peel, deseed, and finely grate the white pumpkin.  

2. **Drain Water**  
   Squeeze out all excess water using a clean cloth or strainer.  
   👉 *Save the pumpkin water for cooking.*  

3. **Measure Ingredients**  
   Use equal measures of grated pumpkin, pumpkin water, and sugar.  
   *(Example: 1 cup grated pumpkin → 1 cup pumpkin water + 1 cup sugar)*

4. **Cook Pumpkin**  
   In a heavy-bottomed pan, combine the pumpkin water and grated pumpkin.  
   Cook on medium-low heat, stirring continuously, for about 15–20 minutes until softened and water is mostly absorbed.

5. **Add Sugar**  
   Stir in the sugar. The mixture will loosen and become watery — this is normal.  
   Keep cooking for 10–15 minutes until it thickens again.

6. **Add Saffron**  
   Add saffron strands and continue stirring on medium heat.

7. **Add Ghee Gradually**  
   Start adding ghee in intervals — 2 tbsp at a time. Stir well after each addition.  
   Continue for 20–25 minutes until the halwa becomes glossy and ghee starts to release from the sides.

8. **Flavor with Cardamom**  
   Add cardamom powder and mix well.

9. **Roast Cashews**  
   In a separate small pan, roast the broken cashews in a spoon of ghee until golden.  
   Add them to the halwa and mix.

10. **Optional – Add Green Camphor**  
   Turn off heat. Add a small pinch of edible green camphor and stir.  
   ❗ *Do not cook further after adding camphor.*
