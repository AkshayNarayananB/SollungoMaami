# Ginger Chutney Recipe | Inji Chutney  

“Spice up your tiffin with the bold, tangy-sweet flavors of Ginger Chutney!”  

If you’ve ever tasted a South Indian breakfast spread, you know the magic of chutneys that bring every dish alive.
Among them, Ginger Chutney (known as Inji Thuvaiyal in Tamil or Allam Pachadi in Telugu) stands out for its bold flavor — a fiery blend of roasted ginger, lentils, and spices, beautifully balanced with the tang of tamarind and the sweetness of jaggery.

This chutney is not just about taste — it’s also a digestive powerhouse. Traditionally made to pair with idli, dosa, pesarattu, and even steaming hot rice, it’s that one chutney that can turn a simple meal into a comforting feast.
