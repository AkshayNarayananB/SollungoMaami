# 🥦 Cauliflower Sabzi | Spiced & Flavorful Dry Curry  

✨ *“Golden florets, rich spices, and a touch of kasuri methi magic!”* ✨  

This Cauliflower Sabzi is a simple yet flavorful North Indian-style curry where cauliflower florets are first marinated in spiced yogurt, then cooked with sautéed onions, ginger, garlic, and fragrant masalas. The final touch of kasuri methi elevates its aroma, making it a wholesome dish to pair with chapati, paratha, or even plain rice.
