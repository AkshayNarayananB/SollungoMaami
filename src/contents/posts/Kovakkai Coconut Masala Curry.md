# 🥥 Kovakkai Coconut Masala Curry | No Onion No Garlic Recipe  

“Turn everyday kovakkai into a creamy, aromatic curry that’s perfect for satvik meals, festive thalis, or comforting family dinners!” 

Kovakkai (Ivy Gourd/Tindora) is often made as a simple stir-fry in South Indian homes. But here’s a twist – by combining steamed kovakkai with a flavorful coconut-cashew-fennel paste, you can create a creamy, aromatic curry that pairs beautifully with rice, chapati, or even dosa. This recipe balances the natural taste of kovakkai with the richness of coconut and cashews, making it a wholesome family favorite.

Since it’s **made without onion and garlic**, it’s ideal for fasting days, poojas, or when you want something light yet wholesome.
