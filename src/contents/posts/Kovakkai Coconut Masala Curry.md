3. **Combine with kovakkai** – Add the steamed kovakkai, mix, and cook for 2–3 minutes.  
4. **Prepare the coconut paste** – Grind coconut, cashews, fennel, green chili, ginger, clove, and cinnamon into a smooth paste with little water.  
5. **Make the curry** – Add the paste to the kadai, mix well, add salt, and a little water (if needed) to adjust consistency.  
6. **Simmer** – Cook for 5–7 minutes until the curry thickens and flavors blend.  
7. **Finish** – Garnish with coriander leaves, mix well, and switch off the flame.

## 💡 Tips  

- Don’t overcook kovakkai during steaming – keep it just soft so it holds shape in curry.  
- If you like richer gravy, add 1 tbsp fresh cream at the end.  
- Adjust water depending on whether you want a thick curry for chapati or a thinner version for rice.  
- For spicier curry, add 1 dry red chili while grinding.  
- Since this is **no onion, no garlic**, balance flavors with extra ginger or green chili if needed.
