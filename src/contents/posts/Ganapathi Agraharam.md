## 🌾 About the Place  

Thanjavur, the land of temples and culture, welcomes you with its lush paddy, banana, and sugarcane fields swaying in the breeze. Mornings here begin with the graceful call of peacocks and the earthy fragrance of wet soil. The lifeline of this region is the holy **Cauvery river**, worshipped daily by villagers for nurturing their farmlands and lives.

## 🛕 The Temple  

In **Papanasam Taluk**, every villager knows of the revered **Ganapathi temple**, maintained solely by the Agrahara community.  

Unlike other places where people worship individual Ganesha idols during **Vinayagar Chaturthi**, here all offerings are made only to the temple deity.  

💫 **Legend says**: Once when someone prepared *kozhukattai* for a separate idol, the neivedyam transformed into **scorpions** — believed to be a result of breaking the temple’s **niyamanam (rule of practice).**  

---

## 📜 Temple History  

- The deity was originally **installed by Sage Agastya**.  
- Later, during a severe drought, **Gautama Maharshi** instructed the villagers to unearth the buried deity.  
- From then on, Ganesha blessed the land and restored prosperity.

## 🐍 Sarpa Vinayakar  

During preparations for a **Kumbabhishekam (Samprokshanam)**, workers cleaning the sanctum heard a snake’s hiss. Ignoring it, one fell sick with a fever that resisted all remedies.  

A divine remedy was revealed:  
- Only the **gurukal (priest)** may enter the garbhagriha.  
- Devotees should chant the **Vinayakar Sahasranamam** and offer **Sweet Pongal** as neivedyam.  

🙏 To this day, those with health issues follow this ritual for relief and blessings.

## 🔥 Kovil & Periyava’s Guidance  

When villagers suffered from hunger and illness, **Periyava** advised them to do a **45-day japam** every **Karthika Masam**, starting from the 2nd Friday.  

- After lighting lamps in every house, elders chant a special **sloka** 366 times.  
- Children are encouraged with gifts — earlier coins, now pencils, notebooks, or biscuits.  
- The collective prayer is for **logakshemam (world peace and harmony).**

## 🥟 Kozhukattai Neivedyam  

The main offering for Pillaiyar here is **kozhukattai** of many varieties.  
- Devotees may prepare it themselves in adherence to **madi-acharam (ritual purity)**.  
- Alternatively, skilled villagers prepare and offer it on behalf of devotees.  

🌟 **Highlight:**  
Mrs. **Latha Ganesan**, a respected resident of Ganapathi Agraharam, is renowned for preparing the neivedyam with devotion and tradition.
