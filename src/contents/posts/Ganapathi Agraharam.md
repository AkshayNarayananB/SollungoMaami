## 🌾 About the Place  

Thanjavur, the land of temples and culture, welcomes you with its lush paddy, banana, and sugarcane fields swaying in the breeze. Mornings here begin with the graceful call of peacocks and the earthy fragrance of wet soil. The lifeline of this region is the holy **Cauvery river**, worshipped daily by villagers for nurturing their farmlands and lives.

## 🛕 The Temple  

In **Papanasam Taluk**, every villager knows of the revered **Ganapathi temple**, maintained solely by the Agrahara community.  

Unlike other places where people worship individual Ganesha idols during **Vinayagar Chaturthi**, here all offerings are made only to the temple deity.  

💫 **Legend says**: Once when someone prepared *kozhukattai* for a separate idol, the neivedyam transformed into **scorpions** — believed to be a result of breaking the temple’s **niyamanam (rule of practice).**

## 📜 Temple History  

- The origins of this sacred shrine trace back to the great Sage Agastya**, who first installed the deity here.
- Centuries later, when the village was struck by a severe drought, **Gautama Maharshi** happened to pass through. Moved by the plight of the people, he advised the Agrahara community to search beneath the earth for a hidden idol of Ganesha.
- ✨ Following his guidance, the villagers unearthed the deity — the very form of Ganapathi that still resides in the temple today. 
- It is believed that once the idol was reinstated and worshipped, Ganesha blessed the land with prosperity, bringing rains and relief to the drought-stricken village.

## 🐍 Sarpa Vinayakar  

During preparations for a **Kumbabhishekam (Samprokshanam)**, workers cleaning the sanctum heard a snake’s hiss. Ignoring it, one fell sick with a fever that resisted all remedies.  

A divine remedy was revealed:  
- Only the **gurukal (priest)** may enter the garbhagriha.  
- Devotees should chant the **Vinayakar Sahasranamam** and offer **Sweet Pongal** as neivedyam.  

🙏 To this day, those with health issues follow this ritual for relief and blessings.

## 🔥 Kovil & Periyava’s Guidance  

When villagers suffered from hunger and illness, **Periyava** advised them to do a **45-day japam** every **Karthika Masam**, starting from the 2nd Friday.  

- After lighting lamps in every house, elders chant a special **sloka** 366 times.  
- Children are encouraged with gifts — earlier coins, now pencils, notebooks, or biscuits.  
- The collective prayer is for **logakshemam (world peace and harmony).**
