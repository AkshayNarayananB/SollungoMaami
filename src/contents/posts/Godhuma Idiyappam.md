## 👩‍🍳 Instructions  

### 1. Dry Roast the Wheat Flour  
- Heat a kadai and add wheat flour.  
- Dry roast on low flame for 2–3 minutes until warm to touch (no color change).  
- Switch off the flame.  

### 2. Mix the Flours  
- Add salt and rice flour to the roasted wheat flour. Mix well.  

### 3. Prepare the Dough  
- Boil 2 to 2.5 cups of water and switch off the flame.  
- Add hot water **little by little** to the flour mixture – just enough to form a dough.  
- Mix with a spatula (it will be very hot).  
- Cover and rest for 10 minutes.  

### 4. Knead the Dough  
- Once warm enough to handle, knead into a smooth, chapati-like dough.  
- *(Tip: Keep a bowl of water nearby to dip your hands if the dough is still hot.)*  

### 5. Shape the Idiyappam  
- Grease the idiyappam press and plates with oil.  
- Fill with dough and press into thin string hoppers on idli plates.  

### 6. Steam  
- Steam in an idli cooker for 5–7 minutes until cooked.  
- Remove carefully and serve hot.

## 🍽️ Serving Suggestions  

- Serve with **vegetable kurma** or **spicy tomato chutney** for breakfast.  
- For a sweet version, drizzle with **coconut milk** and **jaggery syrup**.  
- Add a dollop of **ghee** for extra flavor.  

---

## 🌟 Tips & Notes  

- **Add Water Gradually** – Too much water makes dough sticky and hard to press.  
- **Grease the Press** – Prevents dough from sticking inside the mold.  
- **Do Not Oversteam** – 5–7 minutes is perfect; overcooking makes it rubbery.  
- **Press While Warm** – Cold dough becomes harder to press.
