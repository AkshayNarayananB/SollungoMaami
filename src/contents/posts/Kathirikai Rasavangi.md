## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. **Roast the Grinding Ingredients**  
   Dry roast chana dal, coriander seeds, urad dal, black pepper, and dry red chilies in a kadai without oil until the dals turn light brown.  
   Add ¼ tsp fenugreek seeds and roast for 1 minute. Let it cool.

2. **Cook the Dals**  
   In a pressure cooker, combine chana dal, toor dal, moong dal, turmeric powder, and enough water.  
   Pressure cook for 3 whistles. Mash lightly once cooled.

3. **Prepare Tamarind Water**  
   Soak tamarind in warm water and extract the pulp. Set aside.

4. **Sauté Brinjal**  
   Heat 2–3 tbsp gingelly oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add 2 slit green chilies, a pinch of hing, and sauté the brinjal pieces for 1–2 minutes.

5. **Add Tamarind Water**  
   Pour in the tamarind extract. Cook the brinjals in tamarind water over medium flame for 5–10 minutes, until soft and the raw smell fades.

6. **Grind the Roasted Paste**  
   Grind the roasted spice mix and fresh coconut with little water into a smooth, fine paste.

7. **Combine & Cook**  
   Add the coconut paste to the brinjal-tamarind mixture. Stir well.  
   Add the cooked dals, salt, and curry leaves. Adjust thickness with a little water if needed. Simmer for 5–10 minutes.

8. **Tempering**  
   Heat sesame oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds, urad dal, chana dal, and fry until golden.  
   Add a pinch of hing and pour this tempering over the rasavangi. Mix gently.

## 💡 Points to Remember

- ❗ **No extra water** for brinjal — they release moisture naturally.  
- 🥄 **Rasavangi is traditionally thick** — avoid diluting the flavor with excess water.  
- 🌶️ **Spice it up** with 3–4 green chilies, if desired.  
- 🍆 **Handle brinjal gently** — stir softly after cooking to avoid mashing the pieces.
