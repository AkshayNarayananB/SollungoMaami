## 👩‍🍳 Directions

### Roast the Grinding Ingredients  
1. Dry roast chana dal, coriander seeds, urad dal, black pepper, and dry red chilies in a kadai without oil until the dals turn light brown.  
2. Add ¼ tsp fenugreek seeds and roast for 1 minute. Let cool.

### Cook the Dals  
3. In a pressure cooker, combine chana dal, toor dal, moong dal, turmeric powder, and enough water.  
4. Pressure cook for 3 whistles. Mash lightly once cooled.

### Prepare Tamarind Water  
5. Soak tamarind in warm water and extract the pulp. Set aside.

### Sauté Brinjal  
6. Heat 2–3 tbsp gingelly (sesame) oil in a heavy-bottomed pot.  
7. Add 2 slit green chilies and a pinch of hing.  
8. Add brinjal pieces and sauté for 1–2 minutes.

### Add Tamarind Water  
9. Pour in the tamarind extract. Cook the brinjals in tamarind water on medium flame for 5–10 minutes until soft and raw smell fades.

### Grind the Roasted Paste  
10. Grind the roasted spice mix and fresh coconut with little water into a smooth, fine paste.

### Combine & Cook

14. Add a pinch of hing and pour this tempering over the rasavangi. Mix gently.

## 💡 Points to Remember

- ❗ Do not add extra water for brinjal — they release moisture naturally.  
- 🥄 Rasavangi is traditionally thick — avoid diluting flavor with excess water.  
- 🌶️ Spice it up with 3–4 green chilies if you prefer more heat.  
- 🍆 Handle brinjal gently — stir softly to avoid mashing the pieces.
