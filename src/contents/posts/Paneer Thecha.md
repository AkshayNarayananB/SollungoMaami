# 🌶️ Paneer Thecha | Spicy, Crispy & Protein-Rich  

✨ A bold, flavourful paneer dish coated in a classic Maharashtrian green chilli-garlic-coriander thecha, lightly pan-roasted until crispy on the outside while keeping soft and juicy inside. Perfect for lunch, dinner, or as a starter! ✨  

Paneer Thecha is high in protein, low in oil, and bursting with fresh flavours from coriander, green chillies, garlic, and roasted peanuts. The paste coats each paneer cube perfectly, giving a spicy, nutty crunch that pairs wonderfully with rotis, rice, or wraps.
