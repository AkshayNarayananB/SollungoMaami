## 👩‍🍳 Method

### Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables  
-  Wash zucchini, cut off ends, peel skin completely  
-  Grate zucchini into medium-fine shreds  
-  Grate carrot similarly  
-  Finely chop onion and green chilies  

### Step 2: Season the Vegetable Mix  
-  Combine grated zucchini, carrot, onion, and chilies in a bowl  
- 🧂Add salt (helps draw moisture out)  
-  Add black pepper and asafoetida  
-  Mix well by hand  
-  Let sit 5-10 minutes to release juices  

### Step 3: Prepare the Batter  
-  Add 1 cup gram flour, mix thoroughly  
-  Check consistency: batter should hold shape when scooped  
-  If too watery, gradually add more flour (up to 2 cups)  
-  Final batter: thick but spreadable, like pancake batter  

### Step 4: Cook the Fritters  
-  Heat dosa tawa or non-stick pan on medium heat  
-  Add little oil, spread evenly  
-  Spoon batter onto tawa, flatten gently (3-4 inch diameter)  
-  Drizzle 1 tsp oil around edges and top  
-  Cook 3-4 mins until golden and crispy below  
-  Flip carefully, add 1 tsp oil, cook other side  
-  Cook until both sides are golden & crispy (6-8 mins total)  
-  Drain on paper towel to absorb excess oil
