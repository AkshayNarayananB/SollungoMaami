## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

###  Prepare the Dal

3️⃣ Add salt at the end for best texture.  
4️⃣ Transfer to a mixing bowl.

###  Add Aromatics  
1️⃣ Mix in asafoetida, ginger, green chillies, and curry leaves.  
2️⃣ Wet your hands slightly to mix the batter without sticking.  
3️⃣ The batter should be thick enough to hold shape.

###  Prepare to Fry  
1️⃣ Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai.  
2️⃣ Wet the banana leaf or small plate.  
3️⃣ Keep a bowl of water nearby for shaping.  

###  Shape the Vadas  
1️⃣ Wet your hand, take a small portion of batter.  
2️⃣ Flatten it gently on the wet plate.  
3️⃣ Make a hole in the center.  
4️⃣ Transfer to your palm and gently slide into hot oil.

###  Fry to Perfection

2️⃣ Flip often for even browning.  
3️⃣ Fry until both sides are golden and crispy.  
4️⃣ Drain on paper towels.
