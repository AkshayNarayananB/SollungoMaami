## 👩‍🍳 Instructions  

### 1. Prep the Sundakkai  
- Discard the stems from sundakkai, wash thoroughly.  
- Gently crush each berry using a heavy ladle or rolling pin — this helps them cook faster and absorb flavor.  

### 2. Cook the Dal  
- Add washed **toor dal**, **turmeric powder**, **ghee**, and sufficient water to a pressure cooker.  
- Cook for **3 whistles** until soft. Mash lightly and set aside.  

### 3. Make the Sambar Base  
- Heat **sesame oil** in a sambar pan.  
- Add **mustard seeds** and allow to splutter.  
- Add **sundakkai** and saute until their skin turns whitish-grey.  
- Add **tomatoes** and **hing**. Cook until tomatoes turn soft and mushy.  
- Add **chopped methi leaves**, saute and cook for **5–10 minutes** until they shrink and cook through (this step reduces bitterness).  

### 4. Add Tamarind & Spices  
- Add **tamarind extract**, **sambar powder**, and **salt**.  
- Mix well and boil until the raw smell of tamarind disappears.  

### 5. Finish the Sambar  
- Add the **cooked dal** and mix thoroughly.  
- Simmer on low-medium flame for **5 minutes**.  
- Adjust consistency with water if needed.  

### 6. Serve  
- Serve hot with **steamed rice** and a drizzle of ghee.  
- Pairs well with **potato fry** or **ennai kathirikai (brinjal curry)**.
