## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Make the Dough**  
   In a large mixing bowl, combine ragi flour and wheat flour.  
   Add chopped onions, green chilies, grated carrot, chopped capsicum, curry leaves, and coriander leaves.  
   Sprinkle in salt and a pinch of hing. Mix everything well.  
   Gradually add water, little by little, to form a soft and pliable dough.  
   Cover and rest the dough for 10–15 minutes.

2. **Shape the Adai**  
   Place a piece of butter paper or a banana leaf on a flat surface.  
   Wet the surface slightly with water to prevent sticking.  
   Take a small portion of the dough, roll it into a ball, and place it on the paper.  
   Using wet fingers, gently press and flatten the dough into a medium-thick round adai (not too thin or too thick).  
   Make a small hole in the center of the adai – this helps it cook evenly.

3. **Cook the Adai**  
   Heat a dosa tawa (flat griddle) on medium flame.  
   Carefully flip the butter paper with the adai onto the hot tawa.  
   Gently press and peel off the butter paper.  
   Drizzle a little oil around the edges and in the center hole.  
   Let it cook for 2–3 minutes on medium flame until the base firms up.  
   Flip and cook the other side.  
   Continue cooking on low flame if you want it crispier, pressing gently as needed.

4. **Serve**  
   Serve hot with coconut chutney, pickle, or plain curd.
