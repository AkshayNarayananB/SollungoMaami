## 🛒 Ingredients

-  **Wheat Flour (Godhumai Maavu)** – 2 cups  
-  **Rice Flour** – 1 cup  
-  **Asafoetida (Hing)** – a pinch  
-  **Green Chilies** – 2 to 3, finely chopped  
-  **Curry Leaves** – a few, finely chopped

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Mix the Flours**  
   In a large mixing bowl, combine wheat flour, rice flour, hing, and salt. Mix well.

2. **Add Water & Blend**  
   Slowly pour in water while whisking continuously to avoid lumps. You can use a blender if preferred. Scrape down the sides to incorporate all dry ingredients.

3. **Adjust Consistency**  
   First bring the batter to regular dosa consistency. Then dilute it further until it’s watery, like rava dosa batter.

4. **Add Flavor**  
   Stir in chopped green chilies, curry leaves, and cumin seeds. Taste and adjust salt or spice if necessary.

5. **Heat the Tawa**  
   Heat a dosa tawa (griddle) until it’s very hot. Sprinkle a few drops of water — it should sizzle immediately.

6. **Pour the Batter**  
   Pour the watery batter from the edges inward in a circular motion. Do **not** spread with a ladle — let it naturally form holes and lacy patterns.

7. **Adjust if Needed**  
   If batter doesn’t pour easily, add a little more water. It should flow like thin buttermilk.

8. **Roast the Dosa**  
   Drizzle a few drops of oil around the edges. Cook on **medium flame** until the bottom turns golden brown and crisp.

9. **Flip and Cook** *(Optional)*  
   Flip and cook the other side for about a minute if needed. Press gently to crisp the base.

10. **Serve Hot**  
   Serve immediately with your favorite chutneys or sambar.

## 🌟 Tips

- Add finely chopped **onions** or **grated carrot** to the batter for variety.  
- For **spongier dosas**, keep the batter slightly thicker.  
- Stir the batter between each dosa to prevent settling.  
- If dosas stick, reheat and grease the tawa well before the next pour.
