## 👩‍🍳 Instructions  

### 🔸 Step 1: Clean and Soak  
1. In a bowl, combine **idli rice, Kavuni rice, fenugreek seeds, and aval**.  
2. Rinse well with water 3–4 times until excess starch is gone. (Water will turn purple due to Kavuni rice — this is normal.)  
3. Soak the mixture in **fresh water for 6–7 hours or overnight**.  

### 🔸 Step 2: Grind Batter  
1. Drain the soaked rice completely.  
2. Grind in a mixer as you would for normal dosa, either in **batches or all at once**.  
3. Transfer to a bowl, add **salt**, mix well, and let it **ferment for 8 hours or overnight**.  

### 🔸 Step 3: Check Batter Consistency  
1. Once fermented, the batter should show **bubbles and a slightly risen texture**.  
2. Mix gently. Do **not add water unless the batter is too thick** — it should be pourable but not runny.  

### 🔸 Step 4: Make Dosa  
1. Heat a non-stick tava or cast iron pan.  
2. Pour a ladle of batter and spread gently into a circle.  
3. Drizzle a little oil around the edges and cook until crisp.  
4. Flip if desired or cook only on one side (traditional style).  
5. Serve hot with chutney or sambar.
