## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Dry Roast the Sesame  
 - Heat a dry kadai (pan) on medium flame without oil.  
 - Add black sesame seeds and stir continuously.  
 - Roast for 10-15 minutes until seeds heat evenly.  

### Step 2: Continue Roasting Until Popping

### Step 3: Cool and Grind  
 - Allow sesame seeds to cool completely to room temperature.  
 - Transfer to mixer jar.  
 - Add jaggery.  
 - Pulse grind gently — do not over-grind.  
 - Aim for a coarse powder, not a fine paste.  

### Step 4: Final Preparation  
 - Sesame puranam is ready to use as stuffing.  
 - Should hold shape when pressed, yet remain slightly coarse.
