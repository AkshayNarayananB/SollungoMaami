## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Dry Roast the Sesame  
🔥 Heat a dry kadai (pan) on medium flame without oil.  
⚫ Add black sesame seeds and stir continuously.  
⏰ Roast for 10-15 minutes until seeds heat evenly.  

### Step 2: Continue Roasting Until Popping  
⏰ Keep stirring for another 5 minutes after 15 minutes.  
🎆 Seeds will begin to pop and burst — listen carefully!  
👂 Popping sounds indicate perfect roasting.  
🔥 Roast for 1 more minute once popping starts actively, then turn off heat.  

### Step 3: Cool and Grind  
❄️ Allow sesame seeds to cool completely to room temperature.  
🔄 Transfer to mixer jar.  
🍯 Add jaggery.  
⚡ Pulse grind gently — do not over-grind.  
🌪️ Aim for a coarse powder, not a fine paste.  

### Step 4: Final Preparation  
✅ Sesame puranam is ready to use as stuffing.  
🏀 Should hold shape when pressed, yet remain slightly coarse.
