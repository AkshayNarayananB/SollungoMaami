## 👩‍🍳 Method – How to Make Kovakkai Rice  

1. **Cook and Cool the Rice:**  
   Prepare plain rice and let it cool completely.  

2. **Steam the Kovakkai:**  
   Steam the ivy gourd slightly to soften it.  

3. **Prepare the Tempering:**  
   Heat sesame oil in a wide kadai.  
   Add mustard seeds and allow to splutter.  
   Add urad dal and hing. Roast till dal turns light golden brown.  

4. **Add Kovakkai:**  
   Add the steamed kovakkai along with turmeric and salt.  
   Sauté for 2–3 minutes on medium flame, stirring occasionally.  

5. **Add Curry Podi:**  
   Add the **entire portion of curry podi** prepared earlier.  
   Mix well and cook for 5–7 minutes on medium flame, stirring often.  

6. **Add Peanut Podi:**  
   Add 2–3 spoons of peanut podi for a rich nutty taste.  
   Mix and cook on high flame for 2–3 minutes while stirring continuously.  

7. **Add Cooked Rice:**  
   Reduce to low flame, add the cooked rice, and adjust salt if needed.  
   Gently mix to combine the masala evenly with the rice.  

8. **Final Fry:**  
   Let the rice cook on low flame for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  
   This helps the rice absorb all the podi flavours beautifully.
