## 👩‍🍳 Method – How to Make Vazhaipoo Rice  

1. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a pan.  
2. Add mustard seeds. When they splutter, add chana dal & urad dal.  
3. Roast until golden brown.  
4. Add hing and sauté for a second.  
5. Add the cooked vazhaipoo and mix well.  
6. Cook for **2–3 minutes**.  
   - If vazhaipoo releases water, turn flame to high and fry until moisture evaporates fully.  
7. Add salt and **generous curry powder**.  
8. Mix and cook for **5 minutes** on medium flame so the spice blends well.  
9. Add the cooked rice and curry leaves.  
10. Add roasted peanuts (crush lightly for more crunch).  
11. Mix gently and cook on low flame for **10–15 minutes**, stirring occasionally.  

👉 This final slow cooking helps the masala coat each grain and brings deep flavour.
