## 📜 Temple Significance  

This temple is one among the **108 Divya Desams**, glorified in the *Nalayira Divya Prabandham* by the Alvars. It holds a special place in the *Ramayana* tradition, as it is believed to be the site where Lord **Rama performed the final rites of Jatayu**, the eagle king who valiantly fought Ravana while trying to save Sita.  

Since Sita was not present, **Bhumadevi** (Goddess Earth) manifested from a golden lotus to stand beside Rama during the rites.
