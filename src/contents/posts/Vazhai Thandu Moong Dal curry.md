## 👩🏻‍🍳 Preparation Steps  

1. **Prep the Banana Stem:**  
   Finely chop the **vazhai thandu** and keep it in **buttermilk water** to retain its freshness and prevent discoloration.  

2. **Soak the Dal:**  
   Wash the **moong dal** and soak it in water for about **30 minutes**.  

3. **Tempering:**  
   In a **kadai**, heat **2 tbsp coconut oil**. Add **mustard seeds**; when they splutter, add **urad dal**, **red chillies**, and roast till the dal turns golden.  

4. **Cook the Veggies:**  
   Strain the banana stem from buttermilk, rinse in running water, and add it to the kadai.  
   Add the soaked **moong dal** (after straining water), **curry leaves**, and **salt**. Mix well, cover, and cook for **5–7 minutes** until the vazhai thandu becomes soft and mashable.  

5. **Dry and Finish:**  
   Uncover and cook on **high flame for 2 minutes** if any water remains.  
   Add **grated coconut**, mix gently, and cook for another **5 minutes**, stirring occasionally.  

6. **Cool Before Covering:**  
   Switch off the flame and **don’t cover immediately** — let it cool to retain its texture and freshness.
