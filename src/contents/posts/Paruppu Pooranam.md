## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Dal  
🕐 Soak urad dal in water for 1 hour. Drain and rinse well.  

### Step 2: Grind the Mixture  
🔄 In a mixer jar, combine soaked urad dal, dry red chillies, and a pinch of salt.  
⚡ Pulse grind without water to get a coarse batter-like consistency.  

### Step 3: Steam the Dal  
🍽️ Grease an idli plate lightly with oil.  
♨️ Spread the ground dal mixture evenly.  
⏲️ Steam for 10 minutes on medium-high flame.  
✋ Test doneness — it should not stick when touched.  

### Step 4: Cool and Crumble  
🌡️ Let the steamed dal cool to room temperature.  
👐 Crumble with hands into small pieces to prevent breaking.  

### Step 5: Tempering and Final Cooking  
🔥 Heat sesame oil in a kadai or heavy pan.  
🌿 Add mustard seeds; let them splutter.  
🧄 Add asafoetida; let it sizzle briefly.  
🥄 Add crumbled dal; mix well. It may stick initially.  
⏰ Stir continuously for 5 minutes until it stops sticking.  
🍃 Add chopped curry leaves and mix thoroughly.  
🔄 Continue stirring until mixture binds and leaves the pan sides.  

### Step 6: Finish and Cool  
🔴 Turn off heat once mixture is well combined.  
🥣 Transfer to a bowl; add lemon juice and mix.  
❄️ Cool completely before using as filling.
