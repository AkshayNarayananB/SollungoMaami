-  Salt to taste

## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Dal  
 Soak urad dal in water for 1 hour. Drain and rinse well.  

### Step 2: Grind the Mixture  
 In a mixer jar, combine soaked urad dal, dry red chillies, and a pinch of salt.  
 Pulse grind without water to get a coarse batter-like consistency.  

### Step 3: Steam the Dal  
 Grease an idli plate lightly with oil.  
 Spread the ground dal mixture evenly.  
 Steam for 10 minutes on medium-high flame.  
 Test doneness — it should not stick when touched.  

### Step 4: Cool and Crumble  
 Let the steamed dal cool to room temperature.  
 Crumble with hands into small pieces to prevent breaking.  

### Step 5: Tempering and Final Cooking  
 Heat sesame oil in a kadai or heavy pan.  
 Add mustard seeds; let them splutter.  
 Add asafoetida; let it sizzle briefly.  
 Add crumbled dal; mix well. It may stick initially.  
 Stir continuously for 5 minutes until it stops sticking.  
 Add chopped curry leaves and mix thoroughly.  
 Continue stirring until mixture binds and leaves the pan sides.  

### Step 6: Finish and Cool  
 Turn off heat once mixture is well combined.  
 Transfer to a bowl; add lemon juice and mix.  
 Cool completely before using as filling.
